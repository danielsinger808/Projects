TAMAGOTCHI — HOW TO PLAY                                                                                                        
  ========================                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
  Your Tamagotchi has four stats, each from 0 to 100:                                                                                 HUNGER     — how full it is. Drops fast. If it hits 0, health drains.
    HAPPINESS  — its mood. Drops slowly.                                                                                          
    ENERGY     — how rested it is. Drops fast.
    HEALTH     — its life force. Only drops when starving. Hits 0 = death.

  ACTIONS
  -------
    feed   — restores hunger (+30)
    play   — restores happiness (+20) but costs energy (-15)
    sleep  — restores energy (+25/turn) over 3 auto-advancing turns
    check  — redisplay stats without advancing a turn
    save   — save your game and quit (resume anytime)
    quit   — save and exit

  Each action (except check and save) advances time by one turn and
  triggers a stat decay cycle.

  MOODS
  -----
    (^‿^)   Happy   — hunger, happiness, and energy are all healthy
    (-_-)   Neutral — stats are okay but not great
    (;_;)   Sad     — at least one stat is critically low
    (-.-)zzZ  Sleeping — resting, no input needed

  TIPS
  ----
    - Feed before hunger hits 0 or health will start dropping.
    - Don't play when energy is low — it can bottom out fast.
    - Sleep is the only way to restore energy. Use it often.
    - Health does not recover on its own — keep hunger up.
    - Your save file is loaded automatically on startup.
    - If your Tamagotchi dies, the save file is deleted.

  SURVIVAL GOAL
  -------------
    Keep all four stats above 0 for as many turns as possible.
    How long can yours live?
